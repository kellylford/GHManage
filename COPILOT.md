# GHManage — Project Knowledge

## What This Project Is

**GHManage** (package name `ghviewer`) is a **wxPython desktop GUI** for viewing and managing
GitHub issues, pull requests, and git metadata — branches, commits, tags, releases,
and CI workflow runs. It is designed specifically to be **screen-reader-friendly** without being
patronizing: keyboard-first navigation, a "Full mode" that includes field names in list rows,
status-bar announcements, and comment navigation via Alt+N/Alt+P.

The app shells out to the **`gh` CLI** for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, repos) and uses
the **GitHub REST API** (via `gh api`) for git metadata that `gh` doesn't have first-class commands
for (branches, commits, tags, compare, workflow runs).

## Architecture

```
ghviewer.py   — UI layer (wxPython). All event handlers, menus, dialogs, list population.
gh_data.py    — Data layer. All `gh` CLI and `gh api` calls, data classes, parsing.
```

**Rule:** `ghviewer.py` never calls `gh` or the API directly. `gh_data.py` never imports wx.
This separation is critical — keep it.

### Data flow

1. User selects a repo → `ghviewer` calls `gh_data.fetch_*` in a background thread
2. `gh_data` shells out to `gh` (or `gh api`), parses JSON, returns `Item` / `Branch` / `Commit` objects
3. `ghviewer` receives results via `wx.CallAfter` and populates the ListCtrl + details panel

### Threading model

All network calls happen in `threading.Thread(daemon=True)`. Results are marshaled back to the
UI thread via `wx.CallAfter`. Never touch wx widgets from a worker thread.

## Key Classes & Functions

### gh_data.py

- `Item` — dataclass for issues/PRs. Has `to_row(columns)` and `to_accessible_string(columns)`.
- `_run_gh(args)` — runs `gh` subprocess, returns stdout, raises `GhError` on failure.
- `fetch_issues(repo, state, limit)` / `fetch_prs(repo, state, limit)` — list issues/PRs.
- `fetch_branches(repo, limit)` — list branches via REST API.
- `fetch_commits(repo, branch, limit)` — list commits, optionally for a specific branch.
- `fetch_commit_detail(repo, sha)` — full commit with file changes.
- `fetch_tags(repo, limit)` / `fetch_releases(repo, limit)` / `fetch_workflow_runs(repo, limit)`.
- `fetch_release_assets(repo, release_id, release_tag, limit)` — a release's files with their
  download counts. The releases endpoint already returns assets inline, so the Releases list
  costs no extra call; this exists so the drill-down view can refresh on its own (R key).
- `total_downloads(releases)` — sum across every asset of every release given.
- `ReleaseAsset` — dataclass for a release file. `Release.downloads` is a computed property
  summing its assets. **Download counts are lifetime running totals** — GitHub exposes no
  date breakdown, so any over-time view would require snapshotting and diffing ourselves.
- `fetch_labels(repo, limit)` / `create_label(repo, name, color, description)` /
  `delete_label(repo, name)` — the Labels view. All three go through
  `resolve_issue_repo`, like the issue calls do: on a fork you browse the upstream
  issues, so a label list from the fork itself would not match them. `gh label list`
  exits non-zero on a repo with no labels at all; `fetch_labels` translates that
  into an empty list rather than an error.
- `Label` — dataclass for a label: name, color, description, url, is_default.
- `fetch_issues` / `fetch_prs` take an optional `label` and pass it to `gh` as
  `--label`. Filtering server-side is the point — an unfiltered page of 100 may
  not contain a single issue with the label you picked.
- `fetch_compare(repo, base, head)` — compare two refs.
- `fetch_item_detail(item, repo)` — re-fetch a single issue/PR with full detail.
- `close_item` / `reopen_item` / `add_comment` — actions on issues/PRs.
- `fetch_pages_site(repo)` → `PagesSite | None` — the repo's Pages config. **None means Pages
  is off**, not that the call failed: every Pages endpoint 404s on a repo without a site, and
  `_is_not_found` turns that into a normal answer.
- `fetch_pages_builds(repo, limit)` — publish history. Two endpoints hide behind this. A site
  GitHub builds itself (`build_type: legacy`) reports on `pages/builds`; a site published by
  Actions (`build_type: workflow`) returns an **empty list** there and its history lives in the
  `github-pages` deployments instead. Legacy sites have deployments *as well*, so the two are
  never merged — it falls back rather than combining, or every publish would appear twice.
- `PagesBuild.kind` says which endpoint a row came from. Builds carry a duration and an error
  message; deployments carry only a state, and their state costs one extra call each (fetched
  concurrently, same as branch commit info).
- `_build_id_from_url(url)` — `pages/builds` rows have **no `id` field**, unlike every other
  list endpoint here. The id has to be read off the end of `.url`.
- `fetch_pages_files(repo, site, limit)` → `list[PagesFile]` — the pages a site serves.
  **There is no API for this.** It reads the git tree of the source branch and maps each file
  onto its live URL, which is more than concatenation: a source path of `/docs` publishes only
  that subtree with the prefix stripped, and without a `.nojekyll` marker a legacy site runs
  through Jekyll, which renders `.md` to `.html` and withholds its `_`-prefixed directories.
  For an **Actions-built site the tree is the source, not the output** — the workflow decides
  what ships. The UI states that caveat; don't drop it.
- `list_repos(limit)` — list user's GitHub repos.
- `detect_repo()` — detect repo from current git directory.
- `sort_items(items, sort_order)` — sort by named order string.
- `fetch_dispatch_spec(repo, path, ref)` → `DispatchSpec` — whether a workflow can be run
  manually and which inputs it declares. **There is no API that returns a workflow's inputs.**
  GitHub's own "Run workflow" form is built by parsing the workflow file, and so is this.
  `ref` matters: a branch that adds an input has a different form from the default branch.
- `_parse_dispatch_spec(raw)` — the YAML parsing half, split out so it is testable without
  network access. Note the `on:` key: YAML 1.1 reads a bare `on` as boolean `True`, so the
  lookup checks both. Falls back to the old substring check if the file will not parse.
- `WorkflowInput` — one declared input: name, type, description, default, required, options.
- `fetch_environments(repo)` — environment names, used to fill the choices for an
  `environment`-typed input (the workflow file declares those without options).
- `dispatch_workflow(repo, workflow_id, ref, inputs)` — trigger a manual run. Inputs go over
  as `gh api -f "inputs[key]=value"`; `gh` turns the bracket syntax into nested JSON.
- `workflow_supports_dispatch(repo, path)` — thin wrapper kept for callers that only need the
  yes/no.

### ghviewer.py

- `GhViewerFrame` — main window. Owns all state: `repo`, `items`, `git_items`, `columns`,
  `sort_order`, `list_mode`, `state_filter`, `tab_filter`, `page_size`, `current_limit`,
  `view_mode`, `commit_branch`, `label_filter`.
- `_build_ui` / `_build_menu` / `_bind_events` — construction.
- `_load_items` — background fetch + populate list (dispatches by `view_mode`).
- **Every list load carries a token** from `_begin_fetch`, and the `wx.CallAfter`
  handlers drop results when `_fetch_is_current` says otherwise. Nothing cancels a
  `gh` call, so a slow fetch will still come back after the user has switched views —
  without the token, a big repo's issues land in whatever view is now on screen, filling
  it with blank rows under the wrong columns and a status bar describing a view you left.
  `_load_items` also snapshots `view_mode` on the UI thread and dispatches on that copy,
  so a switch mid-fetch cannot make the worker choose one branch and report another.
  **Any new async path that writes to the list needs the same treatment**;
  `_on_goto_fetched` is the other one, guarded on the view instead.
- `_switch_view(mode)` — switch between Issues/PRs, Branches, Commits, Tags, Releases,
  Workflow, Labels, Pages. Each drill-down view clears its context here when you leave it
  (`commit_branch`, `artifacts_run`, `assets_release`, `label_filter`) — add a reset for
  any new one. `pages_site` is the exception: it is shared by *both* Pages views, so it
  survives the move between them and clears only on the way out to anything else.
- Drill-down views are registered in `PARENT_VIEW`, which is what makes Backspace step back up.
  A new drill-down needs an entry there, in `VIEW_COLUMNS`, and in `_VIEW_LABELS`.
- `_show_details(idx)` — dispatches to `_show_issue_details` or `_show_git_details`.
- `_navigate_comment(direction)` — Alt+N/Alt+P comment jumping.
- `_refresh_list_display` — re-populate list from `self.items` or `self.git_items` without re-fetching.
- `on_item_activated` — context-dependent: in Branches view, Enter switches to Commits for that branch; otherwise opens in browser.
- `on_select_branch` — Ctrl+B branch picker dialog for Commits view.
- **The Labels view is a view of the Issues view, not a drill-down.** Enter on a label
  sets `label_filter` and loads Issues & PRs restricted to it, which keeps the state
  filter, columns, sorting, and every issue action working. It is deliberately *not* in
  `PARENT_VIEW` — the parent map is keyed by view mode and the drilled-into view here is
  `VIEW_ISSUES`, which has no single parent. Backspace is handled as its own case in
  `on_list_key_down`, guarded on `label_filter` being set, and `on_view_issues` clears
  the filter when you ask for Issues & PRs by name (Ctrl+1) even though the mode does
  not change.
- `NewLabelDialog` — name/description/colour form. Colour is validated as 6 hex digits
  before `gh` is called, and may be left blank for GitHub to choose.
- `_on_label_action_done` — refresh after a label create/delete. Separate from
  `_on_action_done` because a label can be created from any view via the File menu, and
  refreshing the current view would hide the label just made.
- **The Actions menu is the home for anything that acts on the listed item**, whichever
  view it belongs to. `_update_actions_menu` re-labels and enables its entries for the
  current view and is called from `_update_menu_checks` (so every `_switch_view` covers
  it) plus `_select_repo` / `_select_favorites`, where the repo changes without the view
  doing so. A new action belongs there, with an entry in that method.
- **Open Repository or Address** (Ctrl+Shift+O) — `parse_github_url` (pure, module
  level) turns an address into a `GitHubTarget(repo, kind, ref)`. `_open_address` picks
  the view, calls `_select_repo(repo, view)` and then sets `_pending_target =
  (view, kind, ref)`. Every list load passes its items through `_take_pending_row`, which
  consumes the target only on a load of the view it was for and returns the row to land
  on — or schedules the fallback (`_goto_issue` for an issue not in the list,
  `_goto_commit` for a commit). Only a repository's own address pins it.
- **New Issue** (Ctrl+N / N) — `NewIssueDialog` (title + multiline Markdown body,
  Ctrl+Enter submits). `create_issue` sends the body on **stdin** (`--body-file -`,
  `_run_gh(args, stdin=…)`) because a long body on the command line can exceed the
  Windows limit; it resolves the fork's upstream like every other issue action, and the
  dialog names that repo. Unsent text lives in `_issue_drafts[repo]` until created.
  After creation the list reloads with `_pending_target` on the new number.
- **Notifications** (`VIEW_NOTIFICATIONS`, Ctrl+Shift+N, entry second in the repo list,
  counted as "(N unread)"). Data: `fetch_notifications(limit, include_read)` pages **50**
  at a time (GitHub's cap), `Notification` maps the subject's API address to a github.com
  page and number (`_notification_url`). Enter on an issue/PR opens it via
  `_open_repo_from_list` + `_pending_target`, so Backspace returns; anything else opens the
  browser; both mark read. M/U/I/G live in `on_char_hook` (work from the details panel);
  Delete/Ctrl+D is "Mark as Done" through `_delete_focused_item`. Changes run through
  `_run_notification_change`, which looks the gh_data function up **by name at call time**
  (`_NOTIFICATION_CHANGES`) — a dict of the functions themselves bound them at import and
  a test stub of `mark_notification_read` did not take, which marked a real notification
  read. Keep it by name. Read rows stay put until refresh; done rows leave at once.
- **Copy** (Actions ▸ Copy, Ctrl+Shift+C/L/T/I/D) — `copy_values(item)` is a pure,
  module-level function returning a `CopyValues` (link, title, ident, ident_noun, text)
  for every item type, so it is tested without a window. `_COPY_IDENT_NOUNS` names
  the fourth entry per view and must agree with the `ident_noun` the view's items
  give; a new view needs an entry there. With focus in the repo list the commands
  act on that repository instead (`_copy_target`).
- `_delete_focused_item` is the single dispatcher behind Delete, Ctrl+D, and the Actions
  menu entry, so the key and the menu cannot disagree about what Delete means in a view.
  Add new deletable views there and in `_update_actions_menu`.
- **Bare Insert/Delete are handled in `on_char_hook`** — a frame-level `EVT_CHAR_HOOK` —
  **not** in `on_list_key_down` and **not** as accelerators. `EVT_LIST_KEY_DOWN` only
  fires while the list has focus, which made the keys unusable from the details panel,
  and that panel is where the text describing them is read. A bare Delete *accelerator*
  is not an option either: it would swallow the Delete key everywhere in the window.
  Their Ctrl+I / Ctrl+D twins are ordinary accelerators on the Actions menu items, which
  is why those need nothing in the hook. The hook skips everything else, so focused
  controls keep first claim on their own keys, and it ignores the repo list, where
  Delete reads as "remove this repo".
- Status-bar hints are per-view for a reason: a key named in the status bar has to work
  in that view. `Ctrl+B=select branch` is Commits-only — `on_select_branch` refuses
  everywhere else.
- **Pages views** (Ctrl+0 → `VIEW_PAGES`, Enter → `VIEW_PAGEFILES`). Pages lists publishes,
  Enter drills into the pages the site serves, Enter there opens one in the default browser,
  `S` opens the site root from either. Enter in the Pages view ignores which publish is
  selected — the file list is the site as it stands now, and GitHub keeps no per-publish
  snapshot to browse. Pages sits at Ctrl+0 on the end of the menu rather than beside the
  other repo views: inserting it mid-menu would renumber every shortcut below it, which
  is what happened to Favorites when Labels took Ctrl+8.
- `_show_pages_disabled` — Pages off is a real answer, so it says so in the details panel.
  An empty list alone reads the same as a site that has never published.
- `_on_pages_loaded` / `_on_pagefiles_loaded` call `_update_actions_menu` themselves.
  Whether there is a site to open is only known after the fetch, and by then the
  `_switch_view` that would normally refresh the menu has long since run.
- `WorkflowInputsDialog` — the "Run workflow" form, generated at runtime from a
  `DispatchSpec`. choice/environment → `wx.Choice`, boolean → `wx.CheckBox`, everything else
  → `wx.TextCtrl`. Because it is generated rather than hand-written, **labelling is manual**:
  each control gets a preceding `wx.StaticText` *and* a matching `SetName`, so the accessible
  name is right whichever the screen reader picks up. A checkbox carries its own label and so
  gets the name only — a StaticText too would read it twice.
- The manual-run flow is **branch first, then inputs** (`_run_workflow_flow` →
  `_on_workflow_branches_ready` → `_on_workflow_dispatch_ready`). Inputs are declared in the
  workflow file, so they must be read from the branch being run. Reading them first would
  show the default branch's form and silently drop values on any branch that differs.

## Conventions

### Screen-reader friendliness

- **Status bar is the announcement channel.** Use `self._announce(msg)`, which sets the
  status bar's message item. Never call `SetStatusText` directly.
- **The status bar is a `NavStatusBar` of named items** — `message`, `keys`, `filter`, `mode`,
  `update` — set with `status_bar.set_item(key, text)`; empty text takes an item off the bar.
  A view's summary and key hints go through `_set_view_status(message, keys)`; a load in
  progress passes no keys so the last view's keys don't linger. Each item is a focusable
  control laid over its native field (read-only text, or a button for the update) so F6 and
  Left/Right can reach it; the native field keeps the same text for the screen reader's
  read-status-bar command. The controls refuse *keyboard* focus (`AcceptsFocusFromKeyboard`)
  so Tab never lands on them.
- **F6 loop** — `_cycle_pane` in `on_char_hook`: repo list → item list → details → status bar,
  wrapping; Shift+F6 reverses. A new pane goes in `_focus_panes`.
- **Full mode** prefixes field names in list rows: `"number: 208, type: PR, state: OPEN"`.
- **Keyboard first.** Every action has a keybinding. Never add a feature that requires mouse-only access.
- **No patronizing hand-holding.** Don't add "Welcome!" dialogs or verbose tooltips. Power users want speed.
- **Comment navigation** uses Alt+N/Alt+P with position tracking via `_comment_positions`.

### Code style

- Type hints everywhere (`from __future__ import annotations`).
- Dataclasses for data models.
- `Optional[str]` for `repo` (None = detect from current directory).
- Section dividers with `# ── Name ──` in both files.
- `GhError` is the only exception type for data-layer failures.

### `gh` CLI usage

- Issues/PRs: use `gh issue list` / `gh pr list` / `gh issue view` / `gh pr view` with `--json`.
- Actions: `gh issue close` / `gh issue reopen` / `gh issue comment` (same for `pr`).
- Repos: `gh repo list` / `gh repo view`.
- Git metadata: use `gh api` (REST API) — branches, commits, tags, compare, releases, workflow runs.
- Always pass `--repo OWNER/NAME` when `repo` is not None.
- `gh` returns newest-first by default for issue/pr lists.

## Tests

`python -m pytest` from the repo root (pytest is in the `dev` extras). Nothing
in `tests/` talks to GitHub:

- `fake_gh` (in `tests/conftest.py`) replaces `gh_data._run_gh`, the one function
  every gh call goes through. Route replies by a fragment of the command line;
  an unrouted call fails the test. Reply shapes should match what real `gh`
  prints — `gh issue/pr view` give one object, the `list` commands an array.
- `app_data` points favorites and pinned repos at a temp folder.
- An autouse fixture covers every test regardless: `_run_gh` fails if called
  without `fake_gh`, and `APPDATA`/`HOME` point at a temp folder. Tests of
  `_run_gh` itself take `real_run_gh` and patch `subprocess.run`.
- `test_ghviewer.py` calls frame methods (details panel, comment navigation,
  favorites) on a `SimpleNamespace` stand-in, so no window is opened. It needs
  wx importable and skips otherwise.

Add tests alongside any change; CI runs them before building.

## CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/ghmanage.yml` — runs the tests, then builds `ghmanage.exe` via PyInstaller on Windows.
- Triggers on push to `main`, `v*` tags, and PRs to `main`.
- On tag push: creates a GitHub Release with `ghmanage.exe` attached.
- Release notes read from `docs/release-notes-<tag>.md`.
- Uses `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`.

## Release process

The `release` project skill (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`) walks through all of this,
including the checks either side. The short version:

1. Update `__version__` in `version.py`. (`pyproject.toml` reads it from there; CI fails the
   build if the tag and `version.py` disagree.)
2. Create `docs/release-notes-vX.Y.Z.md`. **Required** — the workflow passes it to both
   `vpk pack --releaseNotes` and the release body, so a missing file fails the release.
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Description (vX.Y.Z)"`.
4. Tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`.
5. Push: `git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
6. CI auto-builds and creates the release.

## Roadmap

- **PR diff view** — show file-level changes for a PR in the details panel.
- **Branch comparison** — compare two branches or tags, show commits and file changes.
- **Multi-repo dashboard** — watch multiple repos at once.
- **Workflow run filtering** — filter workflow runs by branch.
